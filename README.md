# yolov8-car-counting-roi
This project uses YOLOv8 with OpenCV bitwise masking to detect and count vehicles only in user-defined ROI (Region of Interest). Ideal for traffic monitoring in lanes, parking lots, or tolls, it minimizes false positives by ignoring irrelevant areas, ensuring accurate vehicle analysis.
